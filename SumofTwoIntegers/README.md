# Problem:  Sum of Two Integers

## Description

Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operators + and  -.


### Constraints:
You may assume both **a** and **b** are within the 32-bit signed integer range.

Your solution should work for both positive and negative integers.

The key to solving this problem is to use bitwise operations


### Example 1:

**Input**: `a = 1, b = 2`
**Output**: `3`

### Example 2:

**Input**: `a = -2, b = 3`
**Output**: `1`
