# Problem: Find the Duplicate Number

## Description

Given an array **nums** containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, but it could be repeated more than once. Your task is to find and return the duplicate number(s).


### Constraints:
The size of the array nums is n + 1.

nums should not be null, and it must have at least two elements (since the size is n + 1 and n must be at least 1).

Each element in nums must adhere to the range [1, n]  (inclusive).

The method returns an integer that is the duplicate number found in the array nums.

### Example 1:

**Input**: `nums = [1,3,4,2,2]`
**Output**: `2`

### Example 2:

**Input**: `nums = [3,1,3,4,2]`
**Output**: `3`


### Example 3:

**Input**: `nums = [1,1]`
**Output**: `1`
